## The first writers

In 2012, I gave [a talk at TEDxUChicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtl9QG4qe6g), in which I discussed the following idea:

When the printing press was invented, the foundation of the world was the written word.

The foundation of the world _today_ is software.

I want to extend the analogy a bit more...

Back in the early times, what were people writing? On this tablet, is the _very first_ name in recorded history (the author's signature):

Do you know what is written here? Try to guess, then click for the answer:

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#firstWrittenName">
  Answer
</button>

<div class="modal fade" id="firstWrittenName" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="firstWrittenNameLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-body">
        "29,086 measures barley; 37 months — Kushim"
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div style="height: 500px;"></div>
